## About Me

In this repo I describe the logic/methodology behind my NCAA basketball model. If you are looking for direct access to the model please click [here](https://ericliamshannon.shinyapps.io/ncaa_bracket/) 

All data for my model comes from [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/).
